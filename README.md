# Rock_Paper_Scissor_Game
The purpose of this project is to create a Rock Paper Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows the user to choose their move (rock, paper, or scissors) by clicking on the corresponding button.
The computer also randomly selects its move. The game then determines the winner of each round and keeps track of the scores for both the player and the computer.
